## Tools and Libraries

This project is built with the following technologies:
- **Python**: Core language for building and training the model.
- **Flask**: Framework for the web application.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing and fine-tuning the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating data visualizations.
- **Heroku**: For cloud deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is structured to include clinical measurements and a target diagnosis label. Below is a detailed description of the fields:

1. **ID**: Unique identifier for each patient. (e.g., 842302)
2. **Mean Radius**: Average size of the tumor, measured in millimeters.
3. **Mean Texture**: Variation in the gray-scale intensity of cells.
4. **Mean Perimeter**: The boundary length of the tumor.
5. **Mean Area**: The overall area of the tumor.
6. **Mean Smoothness**: How regular the tumor's surface is (calculated as the variance of radius lengths).
7. **Diagnosis**: The target label indicating the nature of the tumor:
   - **B**: Benign (non-cancerous).
   - **M**: Malignant (cancerous).
